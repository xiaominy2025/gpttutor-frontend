const testAnswer = `**Strategic Thinking Lens**

In planning production with fluctuating demand and limited storage, you need to adopt a strategic mindset that balances multiple objectives: meeting customer demand, minimizing storage costs, and maintaining operational efficiency. This requires analytical tools like demand forecasting, <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A technique to model and analyze the behavior of a system under uncertainty.">simulation</span> modeling, and optimization techniques to make data-driven decisions.

**Story in Action**

Maria, a production manager at a manufacturing company, faces the challenge of planning production with highly variable customer demand and limited warehouse space. She uses <span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="A technique to model and analyze the behavior of a system under uncertainty.">simulation</span> software to model different demand scenarios and runs optimization models to determine the most efficient production levels.
