# V1.6.5 Section Titles Debug

## Issue
The UI is showing 4 sections with default titles ("Strategic Thinking Lens", "Story in Action", "Follow-up Prompts", "Concepts/Tools") instead of the 3 sections from Decision Lab metadata ("Strategic Thinking Lens", "Follow-up Prompts", "Concepts/Tools").

## Root Cause Analysis

### Expected Behavior
- Decision Lab metadata has 3 sections: ["Strategic Thinking Lens", "Follow-up Prompts", "Concepts/Tools"]
- UI should show only 3 sections, no "Story in Action" section
- Section titles should come from metadata.sections_titles

### Current Behavior
- UI shows 4 sections with default titles
- "Story in Action" section appears with "No story available"
- This suggests sectionTitles array is empty or not being passed correctly

## Debug Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Debug Logging
- Added comprehensive logging in App.jsx to track metadata loading
- Added logging in AnswerCard.jsx to track section titles
- Added metadata change monitoring

### 2. Temporary Test Fix
- Added `testSectionTitles` that forces 3-section titles for Decision Lab
- This will help determine if the issue is with metadata loading or rendering logic

### 3. Improved Fallback Logic
- Enhanced the section titles fallback logic in AnswerCard.jsx
- Added null check for sectionTitles array

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Temporary Fix
**Expected**: Decision Lab should show only 3 sections
- Strategic Thinking Lens
- Follow-up Prompts  
- Concepts/Tools

**If this works**: Issue is with metadata loading
**If this fails**: Issue is with rendering logic

### Test 2: Debug Logs
Check console for:
- `ðŸ”§ App.jsx Debug`: Should show metadata loaded and correct section titles
- `ðŸ”§ AnswerCard Debug`: Should show 3 section titles
- `ðŸ”§ Metadata changed`: Should show sections_titles array with 3 items

## Next Steps

1. **Test the temporary fix** - If it works, focus on metadata loading
2. **Check backend metadata endpoint** - Ensure `/api/course/decision` returns correct metadata
3. **Verify metadata structure** - Ensure sections_titles array is properly formatted
4. **Check timing issues** - Ensure metadata loads before answer rendering

## Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx`: Added debug logging and temporary test fix
- `src/components/AnswerCard.jsx`: Enhanced fallback logic and debug logging

## Metadata Structure Expected
```json
{
  "title": "Decision-Making Practice Lab",
  "sections_titles": [
    "Strategic Thinking Lens",
    "Follow-up Prompts",
    "Concepts/Tools"
  ]
}
```
